# Adaptive Chatbot Framework

## Overview
We're trying to make an adaptive chatbot framework utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) and a modular plugin system. Designed with Object-Oriented Design (OOD) principles, it allows seamless integration of hot-swappable plugins for real-time adaptability.

## Features currently being worked on
- **Modular Plugin System**: Supports dynamic loading/unloading of plugins at runtime.
- **LLM Integration**: Works with multiple models via an adapter pattern.
- **Encapsulation & Polymorphism**: Ensures scalability and maintainability.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/girish-j04/modular_llm.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd modular_llm
   ```
